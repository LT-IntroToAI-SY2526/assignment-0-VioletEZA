## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

The difference between Git and GitHub besides the amount of letters is that Git is a distributed version control system and therefore is a tool to track changes made to code, as well as an easy way to collaborate and share code with others. On the other hand, GitHub is one way to use Git online through an interface that is simple to use.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Committing and pushing are how people can put any changes made on their device to the online repositry located in GitHub. These steps are important because they allow others (classmates or instructors, etc.) to see the changes that were made once they're done.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is thought of like a folder for the project. It also contains the history of any changes made as well as the program files. A repository can be for just someone by themself or for a group of people.
