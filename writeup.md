**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

The difference between Git and GitHub besides the amount of letters is that Git is a distributed version control system and therefore is a tool to track changes made to code, as well as an easy way to collaborate and share code with others. On the other hand, GitHub is one way to use Git online through an interface that is simple to use.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**
